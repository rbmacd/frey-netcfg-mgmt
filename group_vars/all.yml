# ============================================
# NetBox is the Source of Truth
# ============================================
# All network configuration data should be defined in NetBox config context:
#   - DNS servers (per site or device)
#   - NTP servers (per site or device)
#   - Syslog servers (per site or device)
#   - SNMP settings (per site or device)
#   - Timezone (per site or device)
#   - VLANs, interfaces, BGP, etc.
#
# This file intentionally left empty.
# If you find yourself adding data here, ask: "Should this be in NetBox?"
#
# The ONLY exception might be:
#   - Organizational metadata (project_name, contact_email, etc.)
#   - Values that are truly universal and never change
